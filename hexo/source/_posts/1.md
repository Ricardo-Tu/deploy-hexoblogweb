# Theme of this article
Windows NT is a layer-oriented operating system, the bottom layer is the hardware, and the top layer is the user interface. Windows uses this mode to protect the kernel from being affected by application errors. The core of the operating system runs at the kernel layer (Ring 0 ). User mode runs at the application layer (Ring 3). This is just an abstraction of OS layering. This article aims to discuss the specific implementation process of the Windows operating system from Ring3 to Ring0 in IA-32e mode, and will also compare some of the differences in IA-32 mode. The IA-32e test system in this article is Windows 10 2004.

# System call
The Windows operating system enters the kernel through three ways: task gate, trap gate and interrupt gate. After the task gate executes the syscall instruction through the application layer, it executes the system call distribution function KiSystemCall64Shadow, and the address of this function is stored in the MSR register of IA32_LSTAR (0xc0000082).
![](1.png)
When we call an API from the application layer, it will enter the kernel through the ntdll of the application layer. When the syscall instruction is executed, the register changes according to some rules. This article introduces some examples:

- Store the address of the next instruction of syscall in the rcx register
- Set rip to the value in the IA32_LSTAR register
- The value of the Selector field in the cs register is set to the value of the 32-bit to 47-bit value and the value of 0xFFFC in the IA32_STAR (0xc0000081) register
- The Selector field of the SS register is the value of the 32-bit to 47-bit value in the IA32_STAR (0xc0000081) register and the value of 0xFFFC plus 8

So before calling the syscall instruction, some preparatory work is required, the index number of the function in the SSDT table is stored in the rax register, and the value of rcx is placed in the r10 register.
![](2.png)
 First, we set a breakpoint at ntdll!NtOpenProcess, and set a second hardware breakpoint in the KiSystemCall64Shadow function (note that the breakpoint under KiSystemCall64Shadow needs to be set after the swapgs instruction, and the breakpoint processing function needs to use the kernel stack. Set a breakpoint at swapgs, it will be stuck).

First set a breakpoint in ntdll!NtOpenProcess, then windbg is interrupted by NtOpenProcess after running, and then set a hardware breakpoint in KiSystemCall64Shadow. After running, it is interrupted by KiSytemCall64Shadow.

Then find the KeServiceDescriptorTable structure pointer, which is an undisclosed structure, but someone has reversed this structure, the structure is as follows:
```c
typedef struct _KSERVICE_TABLE_DESCRIPTOR
{
    PVOID  Tablebase;
    PULONG   ServiceCountBase;
    ULONG64  ServiceNumber;
    PVOID ParameterNumer;
}KSERVICE_TABLE_SECRIPTOR,*PKSERVICE_TABLE_DESCRIPTOR;
```
![](4.png)
Set a breakpoint at lea r10, KeServiceDescriptorTable, and dynamically debug and observe the code to understand the relationship between the values ​​of r11 and r10.
![](5.png)
The relationship between these two tables is shown in the figure:
![](6.png)
From the relationship in the figure, it is not difficult to understand the process of obtaining the function address in the SSDT table:
![](7.png)
After obtaining the function address, the next step is to copy the parameters and execute the function. Finally, call sysret, the sysret instruction is opposite to the syscall instruction, restore the user layer stack, put the return address into rcx, and set the value of rcx to rip after execution.

# Abnormal
Exceptions are divided into interrupts, errors, and traps. Interrupts are generally used to handle hardware interrupts, such as keyboard interrupts, mouse interrupts, etc. Errors are generally used to handle errors, such as page faults, etc.
While the processor is executing an instruction, it is possible to trap an exception. For example, dividing by 0 is wrong. Exceptions are generally divided into errors and traps. For example, if there is a page fault exception, when the page is written into the physical memory from the pagefile, after the physical page is mounted, it will be executed from the original instruction. For example, an instruction such as syscall is a trap, and it will be executed from the next instruction after returning. In Intel's x64, an IDT table with 256 entries is defined. The difference between an interrupt and an exception is that the difference between an interrupt and a trap is that the interrupt will be turned off (the IF flag is cleared) when the interrupt handler is executed, and the IF flag will not be cleared by the trap. Each part of the interrupt gate descriptor is as follows.
![](8.png)
DPL is to trigger the mid-level permission check. If it is in Ring3, it can only trigger the interrupt with DPL 3, while Ring0 can trigger the interrupt with DPL zero or three.
The figure below shows some interrupt gate descriptors and function addresses of Windows 10 2004 interrupts.
![](9.png)
 For example, item 0, the gate descriptor is ```6b628e00`0010a100 00000000`fffff801```, the function address is 0x fffff8016b62a100, P is 1, DPL is 0 (this interrupt ring 3 cannot be triggered), TYPE is 6, IST is 0 (IST is 0, It shows that the IST0 stack is used , and this value needs to be indexed in the TSS pointed to by the GDT table). In the x64 intel chip manual, it is written that Segmentation is not used, and there is only one TSS segment in the GDT table.
![](10.png)
Item 2, the gate descriptor is ```6b628e03`0010a240 00000000`fffff801``` , the function address is 0x fffff8016b62a240 , P is 1, DPL is 0, TYPE is 6, IST is 3, the stack pointer used by this non-maskable interrupt is 0xFFFFF8016E7567D0 , which is the above The value of IST3 in the figure, look for this table, first read the value of the tr register, its size is the offset of the TSS segment descriptor in the GDT table, the TSS segment descriptor has 128 bits, and the address is obtained by parsing, this address is the above Figure address.
