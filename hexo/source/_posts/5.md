# Overview
It was the first time I tried to write a game modifier tutorial. I was a little nervous. I struggled for a long time. I didn’t know what game to write. Finally, I decided to find an old game from 20 years ago. It is relatively simple and easy to use. The knowledge of game modifiers is related to memory and assembly, and this knowledge is relatively boring. I hope that some such tutorials can arouse everyone's interest in learning memory-related knowledge. This is the first time I write such an article, I hope everyone can understand it and realize it by yourself.
Finally, I just want to say one more thing: the most basic concept of the game modifier is memory, and all operations are based on memory!!!

# Implementation steps
We know that in the FPS game cs1.6, each character is positioned by coordinates, which are usually Cartesian coordinates. So first you need to find the coordinate position of the character.
## Search for character coordinates
1. First fuzzy search for the unknown initial value of float type (when you don’t know what type it is at the beginning, put integer, float, double all can be found)
![1](1.png)
2. Set the search shortcut key, which is set as the key you are used to (if it conflicts with the game key, it will be inconvenient).
![2](2.png)
3. Walk freely on the flat ground in the game, shake the mouse at will, search for the unchanged value, jump to search for the changed value, search for the changed value again after landing, and then search for the unchanged value. Repeat the above steps until no more exclusions can be made.
![3](3.png)
- Delete the above green addresses, these are static addresses, first exclude. Then add the remaining addresses to the address list, lock them one by one, and finally find out that the characters cannot jump after two addresses are locked. One of the addresses stores the z-coordinate increment, and the other address stores the value of the z-coordinate. After being locked, the character cannot jump.

- Check the relevant memory to know the coordinates of xyz and the increment of xyz axis.

- Attachment: This is a dynamic address, the address will be applied after restarting the game, so you need to find its pointer mapping set. Use the pointer scanning function, restart the game, find the coordinates of the character again, and you can find its pointer and offset. (Note that the folders and file names saved by the pointer scanning function cannot have Chinese characters) Most of the found ones can be used. The xyz coordinates can be accessed by repeatedly reading memory plus offsets. This step is not used in the implementation of teleportation, and it will be introduced next time when it is used and other functions are introduced.

4. Then find out what accessed the address pointed to by the pointer

5. Check the assembler program where each item is located , and check the address accessed by the instruction. This one command is the one that only accesses our coordinates.

## Inline Hook
1. Use Inline Hook to modify the flow of program execution here.
Modified instructions:
```bash
D8 40 10    - fadd st(0),dword ptr ds:[eax+10]
D9 CA       - fxch st(0), st(2)
8B 44 24 04 - mov eax,dword ptr ss:[esp+4]
```
Jump instruction: (6 bytes are used, three instructions are covered, and the address to jump back to is the address after the three instructions)
![9](9.png)
2. Set the flag and set the global shortcut key. When a key is pressed, the current position is saved. When moving to a certain position, press another global shortcut key to teleport to the saved position. My implementation is to press F8 to set a flag, jump to the above address, and access the x, y, z coordinates through [eax+0x8], [eax+0xc], [eax+0x10] and save them. When pressing When F9 is pressed, another flag is set, and the flag is judged. If it is set, the saved address is loaded to realize teleportation.
I set this flag to search for a lot of 0 data. After searching, I call the VirtualProtectEx function to modify the page attribute to be readable, writable and executable. These addresses are used to store the flag and the address we saved.
![10](10.png)
3. Use x32dbg to complete the judgment of Flag and save and load the assembly code of character coordinates.
![11](11.png)
4. Put the above shellcode into the target address, use the jump instruction to overwrite the original instruction and jump to it, and add the address of the next instruction that jumps back to the overwritten instruction after this shellcode.
![12](12.png)
Debug the above program, interrupt and view local variables, pRemoteBuf is the address applied by the cs1.6 process (cross-process application memory).
![13](13.png)
5. Check the cs1.6 game and interrupt to the modified instruction.
![14](14.png)
6. Tracking into pRemoteBuf, single-step debugging.
![15](15.png)
7. Finally returned to mp.dll + 8E8C4. 
![16](16.png)
8. Press F8 to view the target memory address, and the current character coordinates are successfully stored.
![17](17.png)
9. The character moves to a place at will, press F9, the character teleports to the stored position. success!

# Summary
Finally, a picture summarizes the implementation ideas:

Due to various reasons, the article has not been updated for a long time. I originally planned to publish several tutorials on game modifiers. Due to various reasons such as writing a graduation thesis and finding a job, I have not finished it. I just hold back this article It took two days to finish. I hope it can bring some interest to everyone in learning pointer memory and other knowledge. The road to learning is too long. Every time I learn some new knowledge, I think that I should be able to get started after learning these things. I have the same idea, I don’t know the Year of the Monkey before I can get started. I also often watch online masters sharing technology in forums. I am really envious. I don’t expect to be a master anymore, I only hope to become a middle hand (hand of China, hand of the country) hahaha. I will continue to develop other functions of the modifier when I have time. In short, I hope everyone can understand this chapter and complete their own modifiers.

**There are still many deficiencies in the learning process, and I hope friends can correct me!**
