*Some time ago, I read the article on IAT Hook on the Internet, and it happened that the end of the semester was on holiday early, and I wanted to try it myself, so I followed the online tutorial to realize the Chinese version of the calculator that comes with the Windows system. If it is implemented, it only applies to dll injection and IAT Hook, and it is relatively simple to implement.*
*The approximate implementation idea is: write a dll, hook the target API (usr32.SetWindowTextW) for displaying numbers in the dll, change the Arabic numerals 0-9 in the buffer to Chinese characters 0-9 before executing the function, and then change The function can be realized by injecting the dll into the target process. Without repeating the details, next I directly write down my specific implementation steps.*

# Write a dll file
This dll file will be injected into the target process(calc.exe process).The implementation of this dll file is:
- Search the original SetWindowTextW function address in user32.

- Write the Detour function to change the numbers 0-9 into Chinese characters 0-9.

- Traverse the memory space of the target process and locate the import table.

Use OriginalFirstThunk to traverse function names to find the target function, and the corresponding value of FirstThunk is the address of the target function

- When injecting the dll, replace the detour function address with the original function address, save the original function address, and restore it when uninstalling

# Inject the above dll file into the calc.exe process
- Elevate authority

- Traverse the process and find calc.exe

- Inject the dll into the target process

# Test results
- Execution process after the modified function is called

- Compile after writing according to the above steps. The test result is as shown in the figure below. The digital input in the system calculator has been modified to Chinese character input

- The test system version is 64-bit win7 7601.

*Going around has grown from a child to a working adult. In the past six years of self-learning computer, I have been confused, anxious, insomnia, inferior, loved and hated. From a person who never drank to now able to drink some alcohol. From a technical novice to now is still a novice. I was always shy before, and I am still so shy now. In the past, I was always eager for success, but in the end nothing was achieved. I have studied embedded development, Reverse, and Web, and finally found that what I have learned is only the tip of the iceberg. I used to think about living freely, but now that I am an intern, I feel a little out of place on my own. After learning reverse engineering for so long, the content of my work has nothing to do with reverse engineering, and I still feel a little sad. There are still very few jobs related to reverse engineering. So many years of learning can be regarded as entertainment. Generally speaking, my own knowledge is not broad enough, and I should read more, endorse more, and learn more from outstanding people around me.*

**There are still many deficiencies in the learning process, and I hope friends can correct me!**
